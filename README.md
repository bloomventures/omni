# Bloom Omni

A collection of lein tools, namespaces and functions, commonly used across Bloom projects.

## Using Omni

Include the following dependency in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[bloom/omni "0.2.0"]
```

## Dev

- should have unit tests for each public function
- files should be cljc if possible (unless it doesn't make sense)

Installing locally:

`lein install`
